# Ceasar-Cipher-Detection
This repository contains a python script which would help to detect the type of Caesar cipher and decode it. 

Caesar cipher is a type of cipher employed by Julius Caesar in order to encode his messages. This is done by shifting each letter in the message string to a number of predetermined places. 

This program brute forces the different shift lengths and uses **language detection** to identify what the decoded message is and determines by how many places the letters are shifted. The language detection tool is obtained from https://detectlanguage.com/
and the corresponding API key is also obtained from there.
